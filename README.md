As defined on the Blizzard website (the company that develops the game) 'StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the long-awaited sequel to the original StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment’s critically acclaimed sci-fi real-time strategy (RTS) game. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is both a challenging single-player game and a fast-paced multiplayer game.
In typical real-time strategy games, players build armies and vie for control of the battlefield. The armies in play can be as small as a single squad of Marines or as large as a full-blown planetary invasion force. As commander, you observe the battlefield from a top-down perspective and issue orders to your units in real time. Strategic thinking is key to success; you need to gather information about your opponents, anticipate their moves, outflank their attacks, and formulate a winning strategy.'

It combines fast paced micro-actions with the need for high-level planning and execution. Over the previous two decades, StarCraft I and II have been pioneering and enduring e-sports, 2 with millions of casual and highly competitive professional players. Defeating top human players therefore becomes a meaningful and measurable long-term objective.

From a reinforcement learning perspective, StarCraft II also offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore many challenging new frontiers.

  <li>it is a multi-agent problem in which several players compete for influence and resources. It is also multi-agent at a lower-level: each player controls hundreds of units, which need to collaborate to achieve a common goal.</li>
  <li>it is an imperfect information game. The map is only partially observed via a local camera, which must be actively moved in order for the player to integrate.</li>
